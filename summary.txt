**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A complete frontend prototype for the GrowShell application exists, built with React, TailwindCSS, and shadcn/ui. The  has been extensively redesigned through multiple user feedback loops, resulting in a refined layout with complex, feature-rich job cards. A new, comprehensive, multi-tabbed  has also been created and is functional. All data and backend logic remain mocked.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The agent started creating a new  as requested by the user. The agent created the file (), added its route to , and began refactoring the  component inside . The goal of the refactor is to convert the class-based component into a functional component to use the  hook, which will enable navigation to the new  when the Resume Tailor button is clicked.
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? frontend testing agent. The agent needs to verify that clicking the Resume Tailor button correctly navigates to the new page, and then test the UI and functionality of the  itself once it's built.
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - Issue 1: The Resume Tailor button on the  is not functional. The agent was in the middle of refactoring the  to add the necessary navigation logic. This work is incomplete. (Priority: P0)
  - Issue 2: The mocked authentication state does not persist across page navigations (e.g., going directly to  redirects to ). This makes testing cumbersome, requiring a login flow for every test scenario.

  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1: 
     - Attempted fixes: The agent started by creating the new page and route. It then identified that the  needed to be a functional component to use React Router's hooks for navigation. The refactoring process was started but not finished.
     - Next debug checklist: 
        1. Complete the refactoring of  in  into a functional component.
        2. Import and use the  hook within .
        3. Attach an  handler to the Resume Tailor button that calls  to pass the selected job's data.
        4. Build the UI for the  based on the user's request for a better UI than the provided screenshot.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?: This will complete the user's request to link the Resume Tailor button to a new dedicated page for resume optimization.
     - Status:  IN PROGRESS
     - Is recurring issue? N
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?: frontend
     - Blocked on other issue: None
  - Issue 2: 
     - Attempted fixes: The agent has been using workarounds, such as performing a full login-and-navigate sequence for every screenshot or manually setting . No permanent fix has been attempted.
     - Next debug checklist: 
        1. Investigate the  to understand why the  state is not being persisted.
        2. A potential fix is to use  or  within the  and  functions in  to store the auth state.
        3. On initial app load, check storage for the auth state and initialize the context with it.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?: Fixing this would streamline the development and testing process, eliminating the need for repeated logins.
     - Status:  NOT STARTED
     - Is recurring issue? Y
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?: frontend
     - Blocked on other issue: None

**In progress Task List**:
  - Task 1:  Complete the  implementation.
     - Where to resume: Continue the refactoring of the  component in  to enable navigation.
     - What will be achieved with this?: A new, functional page for resume tailoring will be accessible from the job details panel, fulfilling the user's latest feature request.
     - Status:  IN PROGRESS
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?: frontend
     - Blocked on something: None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
*   **Upcoming Tasks (P0):**
    *   Build the UI for the , ensuring it's an improvement over the user-provided screenshot. It should likely feature a side-by-side view of the job description and the user's resume, with tools for editing and keyword matching.
*   **Future Tasks (P1):**
    *   **Backend Integration:** Connect the frontend to a real backend for user authentication, data persistence, and job data.
    *   **Resume Processing:** Implement actual resume parsing and keyword matching against job descriptions on the .
    *   **Payments:** Integrate a payment processor for the Pro and Premium subscription plans.
    *   **LinkedIn Import:** Add functionality to import profile data from LinkedIn.
    *   **Profile Completeness Tracking:** Add a visual indicator and logic to track how complete a user's profile is.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Jobs Page Layout Redesign:** The layout was completely overhauled. Filters were moved from a left sidebar to a horizontal bar below the search inputs.
- **Iterative Job Card Redesign:** The  component went through numerous revisions based on user feedback and reference images, settling on a full-width design that combines detailed job information on the left with a dedicated match-score panel on the right.
- **UI Polishing:** Adjusted card dimensions, spacing, and text sizes multiple times to achieve a compact and visually appealing layout. Added tooltips for match score breakdowns.
- **Profile Page Implementation:** Created a new, fully-featured  () with tabs for Personal, Education, Work Experience, Skills, and Equal Employment, and successfully linked it from the main navigation sidebar.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
   - **Session Persistence:** The mocked authentication state is lost on page reloads or direct navigation, making testing inefficient. The agent noted this multiple times but used workarounds rather than implementing a persistent state solution (e.g., using ).

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - N/A

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React.js
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with a design-system-first approach using CSS variables for theming.
-   **UI Library:** shadcn/ui
-   **Animations:** 
-   **State Management:** React Context API
-   **Routing:** 

**key DB schema**
  - N/A. Frontend-only prototype.

**changes in tech stack**
  - None in this session.

**All files of reference**
-   : The most heavily modified file. It contains the logic for the job list, filters, and the  which is currently being refactored.
-   : Modified to add the new  and  routes.
-   : A new file created to build the user's profile section.
-   : A new file, currently a placeholder, for the resume tailoring feature.
-   : Modified to include data for the new match score breakdowns and HR emails.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-    is a monolithic file exceeding 800 lines. It contains multiple distinct components (the main page layout, the filter bar, the job list, the job card, and the details panel) that should be extracted into their own files to improve maintainability and readability.

**key api endpoints**
- N/A

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   Your immediate priority is to complete the  feature. This starts with finishing the refactor of  in  to enable navigation.
-   The user is highly visual and detail-oriented. Every UI change will be scrutinized. Use screenshots to verify your work.
-   The application's mocked authentication is not persistent. You will need to log in at the start of every testing sequence. A typical flow is  ->  -> perform actions. Consider fixing this with  to save time.
-   The  file is very large. Be mindful when editing it. A future refactoring task should be to break this file down.
